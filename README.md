# Auth0 Landing

This landing is built on Next.js framework. It’s kind of an overkill for something this simple but I really wanted to show my work implementing HTML and SASS in a Javascript framework.

## Dev Enviroment

```
npm install
```

And then to start the development environment you run

 ```
npm run dev
```

## The Stack

I wanted to use Next.js since it’s the latest technology I’ve been using. I’ve developed the new site for A24 news channel in my current company, Aerolab.
Also, I used SASS as a CSS Pre-Processor since it’s still my favorite.
To keep my code clean I used the eslint config from Airbnb with a couple a tweaks.

## Cool thins to notice

Used a fake API on lib/People.js to get the data of each item.
Used a custom dropdown for the filter selection and a native select on mobile.
Decided to **filter** the items insted of odering them since I didn't knew the criteria for ordering this.
